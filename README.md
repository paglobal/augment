Build cross platform desktop apps with PromethiumJS and Go

This is a relatively new project that arose from my own needs to build lightweight cross-platform desktop apps that use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for their UI, and Go as their backend language to extend their functionality beyond what a web frontend is capable of. This framework is currently being implemented in a cross-platform file transfer app I'm building, and I'll push the code for the framework here as soon as I'm done separating the framework into it's own stand-alone package.
